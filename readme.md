## A simple Study Project
---
This project is nothing more than the exercise "Sentiment Analysis" from the "One Week Python" course from Colt Steele given a step further.

Instead of watching the code-along video, I will be building this on my own, reading the package docks and trying to build the functionality shown in the course.

I am new on Python and development in general, and I think this is a fun project - even if it is simple - to build from scratch using my own brain - specially because I loved the 1984 reference.

When I get the functionality I desire from this code, I will leave it as it is, and if you, for any reason is reading this and the code, feel free to comment and suggest improvements.

But really, this is something I will drop here and leave as a reminder of my days learning Python.
